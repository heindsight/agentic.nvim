# agentic.nvim

Domain glossary for agentic.nvim. Defines terms that are overloaded, ambiguous,
or unique to this project. Not a spec. Not a design doc. Implementation details
belong in `AGENTS.md` (rules) or `docs/adr/` (decisions).

## Language

### Process and protocol

**Provider**: External CLI tool spawned as a subprocess (e.g.
`claude-agent-acp`, `gemini`, `codex-acp`). Speaks ACP over stdio. _Avoid_:
backend, server, model, agent (without qualifier).

**ACP (Agent Client Protocol)**: Newline-delimited JSON-RPC protocol used to
talk to a **Provider**.

**AgentInstance**: The factory and cache for the single, shared **ACPClient**
per **Provider** name. It alone requests provider-process startup by
constructing the client that owns that process. One subprocess per provider,
multiplexed across every **ACP Session**. _Avoid_: agent, client (use the
precise term).

**ACPClient**: The Lua object that owns one **Provider** subprocess and one
**ACPTransport**. Routes RPC responses and `session/update` notifications. One
per **Provider** name, cached by the singleton **AgentInstance**.

**ACPTransport**: Stdio framing layer below **ACPClient**. Splits JSON-RPC by
newlines, preserves partial trailers.

**Subscriber**: Per-`session_id` `ClientHandlers` table registered on
`ACPClient.subscribers`. In practice always the **SessionManager** for that
**ACP Session**. `ACPClient` routes notifications via
`__with_subscriber(session_id, cb)`. _Avoid_: "listener", "consumer".

### Session — the overloaded word

`Session` means three different things at three layers. Use the qualified term.

**ACP Session**: A protocol-level session id, opaque string issued by the
**Provider** via `session/new`. One shared **ACPClient** can hold many; this
plugin activates one per **SessionManager**. _Avoid_: bare "session" when
discussing protocol traffic.

**SessionManager**: The Lua orchestrator for one conversation. Owns the
**ChatWidget**, holds the active **ACP Session** id, routes `session/update`
events to the **MessageWriter**, **PermissionManager**, and **ChatHistory**, and
receives its **ACPClient** from its creator. One SessionManager owns one ACP
conversation for its whole lifetime; starting or loading another conversation
requires another SessionManager. The isolation unit for this plugin. _Avoid_:
"the session" — say SessionManager.

**SessionStarter**: Static factory for a one-shot startup attempt. It waits for
the injected **ACPClient**, sends one `session/new` or `session/load`, and owns
cancellation and late-response cleanup. **SessionRegistry** owns the returned
attempt; **SessionManager** does not depend on SessionStarter.

**Session key**: The integer **SessionRegistry** key, assigned at creation and
stable for the **SessionManager**'s whole life. The only stable identity a
**Session** has; published to users on every hook payload. _Avoid_: keying
anything off a **Tabpage** handle.

**Session title**: Optional local navigation metadata for a **SessionManager**,
held on **ChatHistory**. Derived from the first prompt submit, or seeded by a
**Provider**'s `session/list` item on restore when present. It is never sent to
the provider during `session/new` or `session/load`. Labels session-picker
entries. _Avoid_: bare "title" — say Session title, or **Tool Call** title.

**Session CWD**: The absolute directory a **SessionManager** works in for its
whole life. Sent to the **Provider** as `cwd` on `session/new` and
`session/load`, and the anchor for `@` file-picker paths, which the provider
resolves against it. Fixed at creation: inherited from the source
**SessionManager** when one starts another, else derived from the file buffer
the user acted from by the user's configured rule, else the Neovim cwd. _Avoid_:
bare "cwd" (ambiguous with the Neovim cwd) and "project root" (implies a
repository).

**SessionRegistry**: The module-level singleton mapping **Session key** ->
**SessionManager** and the owner of manager registration, placement, and
replacement. It composes SessionStarter with the inert manager and owns the
startup attempt. `show_session` is the single path that moves a
**SessionManager** into a **Tabpage**; `replace` owns transactional replacement.
Three in-place re-render sites call `ChatWidget:show` directly. See ADR 0008.

**SessionRestore**: Resolves the current manager and its injected **ACPClient**,
or asks **AgentInstance** directly when no manager exists. It lists provider
sessions, reuses the new-session lifecycle choice, and delegates target startup
to **SessionRegistry**. Keeping the source evicts it into the background;
destroying it remains an explicit choice.

### Tabpage scope

**Tabpage**: The Neovim tab. A **placement**, not an owner: at most one
**ChatWidget** is visible in a Tabpage, and at most one Tabpage shows a given
**ChatWidget**. Derived live from `ChatWidget:get_visible_tab_id()` and never
stored. _Avoid_: "tab" (ambiguous with terminal tabs and chat-buffer tabs).

**Background session**: A **SessionManager** whose **ChatWidget** is visible in
no Tabpage — `get_visible_tab_id()` is nil. It keeps its **ACP Session**, keeps
receiving `session/update`, and keeps generating. _Avoid_: "closed session";
closing a widget destroys nothing.

### Lifecycle verbs

Four distinct operations. "Close" named two of them.

**Hide**: Close a **ChatWidget**'s windows while the **SessionManager**, its
**ACP Session** and its generation all stay alive. Produces a **Background
session**. Reversible. _Avoid_: "close", "destroy".

**Destroy**: Remove a **SessionManager** from the **SessionRegistry**, cancel
its **ACP Session**, delete its **ChatWidget buffers**. Irreversible. It follows
explicit user intent, rolls back a newly started replacement target, or tears
down the source after a replacement commits when its lifecycle requires
destruction. _Avoid_: "close"; a **Hide** is not a step toward this.

**Evict**: **Hide** whichever **ChatWidget** occupies a **Tabpage** so another
can take it. The displaced **SessionManager** keeps running as a **Background
session**. _Avoid_: "replace", "swap out" — both imply the outgoing session
ends.

**Replace**: Start or select a distinct target **SessionManager** and keep the
source intact until the target is ready. When the source is visible, show the
target before applying its lifecycle choice so the recorded widget size
transfers without flicker. The default lifecycle destroys the source. Restore
can retain it, which makes placement an **Evict** instead. With a hidden source,
target placement does not change: a newly started target remains hidden, while
an existing claimant keeps its current placement. A newly started target has a
new **Session key**, **ChatWidget**, and state containers. If the requested
**ACP Session** is already owned by another manager on the same **ACPClient**,
that existing manager is the target and no second `session/load` is sent.
Transaction rollback destroys only a newly started target; an existing claimant
remains owned by its original lifecycle. The source stays intact. Distinct from
**Evict**, which only hides the displaced manager.

### UI surface

**ChatWidget**: The UI container for one **SessionManager**. Owns six buffers
(see **ChatWidget buffers**), panel windows, autocmds, and the
**MessageWriter**. Reachable from any of its buffer numbers via
**WidgetRegistry**.

**ChatWidget buffers**: The six buffers held on `ChatWidget.buf_nrs`:

- `chat` — the streaming transcript. Owned by **MessageWriter**.
- `input` — user prompt entry buffer.
- `files` — backs the **FileList** view.
- `code` — backs the **CodeSelection** view.
- `diagnostics` — buffer-diagnostics view attached to the prompt.
- `todos` — backs the **TodoList** view.

When a doc says "chat buffer" it means `buf_nrs.chat` specifically. "Widget
buffer" means any of the six.

**WidgetLayout**: Geometry/window management for **ChatWidget**. Opens, closes,
resizes panels. Applies `PANEL_WINDOW_OPTS` via `vim.wo[winid][0]`.

**Hidden chat float**: Internal floating window holding the chat buffer while
**ChatWidget** is hidden. Preserves fold-state snapshots across hide/show. Not
user-reachable. See ADR 0001.

**BufferGuard**: Redirects foreign buffers out of **ChatWidget** windows, into a
non-widget window in the **Tabpage** the owning widget is visible in. One shared
augroup for every widget; the owner is resolved through **WidgetRegistry**.

**WidgetRegistry**: Module-level map from widget buffer number to owning
**ChatWidget**. How buffer-scoped code reaches its widget without storing a
**Tabpage**. Buffer numbers are global, so module-level state is correct here.

**WindowDecoration**: Winbar text and buffer names. Header state lives on the
owning **ChatWidget** (`ChatWidget.headers`), resolved through
**WidgetRegistry**.

**DiffPreview**: Inline or split diff rendered in the real file buffer, NOT in
the chat buffer. Distinct from **ToolCallDiff** (which is rendered inside the
chat buffer).

**MessageWriter**: Owns the chat buffer content for one **ChatWidget**. Writes
message chunks, **Tool Call Blocks**, status rows. State machine for
sender-header dedup, auto-scroll capture/apply, thinking-block reuse.

**ChatHistory**: Accumulates messages for persistence. Separate from on-screen
buffer state.

**TodoList**: Per-**ChatWidget** renderer for **Plan** events. Owns its own
buffer in the widget, separate from the chat buffer. Empty until first `plan`
update. _Avoid_: bare "todos" for the protocol event — that is **Plan**.

**FileList**: Per-**ChatWidget** holder for files the user attached to the
prompt. Owns its own buffer; renders into the header via `on_change`.

**CodeSelection**: Per-**ChatWidget** holder for code ranges the user attached
to the prompt (`agentic.Selection[]`). Sibling of **FileList**.

### Tool calls

**Tool Call**: A provider-initiated action (file edit, bash, search, etc.)
communicated via `session/update` with `sessionUpdate = "tool_call"`. Goes
through 3 phases: initial, update(s), terminal. Its `title` is the **Tool Call
Block**'s display label, required by the ACP schema, unrelated to **Session
title**.

**Tool Call Block**: The rendered representation of a **Tool Call** in the chat
buffer. Header + top pad + body + bottom pad + status row N. Position tracked by
a range extmark in `NS_TOOL_BLOCKS`. _Avoid_: "tool call" when discussing
rendering — use Tool Call Block.

**ToolCallFold**: Manual fold over a **Tool Call Block**'s body, anchored by the
pad lines. See ADR 0001.

**ToolCallDiff**: Diff extracted from a **Tool Call** and rendered inside the
chat buffer's **Tool Call Block**. Immutable once rendered.

**ToolBlockBorder**: `╭ │ ╰` glyphs drawn via `statuscolumn` to fence each
**Tool Call Block**. See ADR 0002.

**DiffHighlighter**: Line and word highlighting for diffs rendered in the chat
buffer.

### Permissions

**Permission Request**: A provider-initiated `session/request_permission` event
tied to a specific **Tool Call** id. May carry a diff.

**PermissionManager**: Per-**SessionManager** owner of pending **Permission
Requests**, focus state, per-block keymaps. Renders buttons inside the focused
**Tool Call Block**. See ADR 0003.

### Message chunks

**Agent message chunk**: Streaming chunk of the **Provider**'s primary response.
`sessionUpdate = "agent_message_chunk"`. Attributed to the `agent` sender.

**Agent thought chunk**: Streaming chunk of the **Provider**'s internal
reasoning. `sessionUpdate = "agent_thought_chunk"`. Attributed to the `agent`
sender. Reuses one extmark in `NS_THINKING` across chunks.

**User message chunk**: Echoed user input from the **Provider**. Attributed to
the `user` sender.

**Plan**: Provider-emitted todo list, rendered by `TodoList`. No sender header.

### Provider features (per session, keymap-driven)

**AgentConfigOptions**: Per-**SessionManager** orchestrator for provider-side
toggles (mode, model, thought level). For both `session/new` and `session/load`,
reads `response.configOptions` when present; otherwise reads legacy
`response.modes` and `response.models` independently. No public `init.lua` entry
— selectors open from configurable keymaps (`change_mode`, `switch_model`,
`change_thought_level`).

**AgentModes** / **AgentModels**: Legacy-path holders inside
`AgentConfigOptions`. Used when a provider sends `modes`/`models` instead of
unified `configOptions`. Same per-session scope.

**SlashCommands**: Per-session input-buffer completion. Command list arrives via
`session/update` `available_commands_update` and is augmented locally: the
plugin filters out `clear` and auto-injects `/new` if absent. Only `/new` is
intercepted on submit. It uses the shared source-lifecycle choice before calling
`SessionRegistry.replace` for a fresh manager. Every other slash-prefixed line
is sent verbatim to the **Provider**.

### Hooks

**Hooks**: User-registerable callbacks under `Config.hooks` (see
`config_default.lua`). All fire via `vim.schedule` + `pcall`. Every payload
carries the **Session key**. Six hooks today:

- `on_create_session_response` — fires after `session/new` returns.
- `on_prompt_submit` — fires when user submits a prompt.
- `on_response_complete` — fires when the agent finishes a turn.
- `on_session_update` — fires for live non-tool-call `session/update`
  notifications.
  Skipped during session restore.
- `on_file_edit` — fires when a file-mutating **Tool Call** completes (kinds:
  `edit`, `create`, `write`, `delete`, `move`). Skipped during session restore.
- `on_request_permission` — fires for each pending **Permission Request**.

### Reconnect

**Reconnect**: Per-`ACPProviderConfig.reconnect` flag. Default `false`. Max 3
attempts at 2s backoff. Fires on provider process exit. No provider has it
enabled by default.

## Relationships

- A **SessionRegistry** maps each **Session key** to one **SessionManager**.
- A **SessionRegistry** owns each pending **SessionStarter** attempt.
- A **SessionManager** owns one **ChatWidget** and one ready **ACP Session** on
  its injected **ACPClient** for life.
- A **ChatWidget** is visible in at most one **Tabpage**, and a **Tabpage**
  shows at most one **ChatWidget**. Both may be zero.
- The singleton **AgentInstance** caches one shared **ACPClient** per
  **Provider** name; only it initiates provider client and process creation.
- A **ChatWidget** owns one **MessageWriter** which owns many **Tool Call
  Blocks** keyed by tool call id.
- A **Permission Request** belongs to exactly one **Tool Call** (by id) on
  exactly one **SessionManager**.
- **Tool Call Block**, **ToolCallFold**, **ToolCallDiff**, **ToolBlockBorder**
  all describe the same rendered block from different angles
  (content/folding/diff/borders).

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When the user starts a second chat, do we spawn another
> **Provider**?" **Maintainer:** "No. The provider's **ACPClient** is shared. We
> create a new **ACP Session** on that client, and a new **SessionManager**
> owns it under its own **Session key**. Opening a **Tabpage** on its own
> creates nothing."

> **Dev:** "Where does the diff render — in the chat or in the file?"
> **Maintainer:** "Both, different things. **ToolCallDiff** renders inside the
> chat buffer's **Tool Call Block**. **DiffPreview** renders in the real file
> buffer."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "Session" was used to mean **ACP Session**, **SessionManager**, and
  **SessionRegistry** interchangeably. Resolved: three distinct concepts, use
  the qualified term.
- "Tabpage" was used as the ownership key: one **SessionManager** per tab, dying
  with it. Resolved: the **Session key** owns, the Tabpage only places. A
  Tabpage handle identifies nothing.
- "Title" meant four things: `ChatHistory.title` (local, from the first prompt),
  `SessionInfo.title` (provider-side, via `session/list`), `ToolCall.title`
  (block label, ACP-required), and an unused `AgentInfo.title`. Resolved:
  **Session title** covers the first two — the provider's optional value seeds
  the local one on restore when present. For a new session, the first prompt
  seeds it. **Tool Call** title covers the third. The unused one gets no term. ACP
  `session_info_update` may carry a live title, but the current handler treats
  session metadata as informational and does not update the local title.
- "Close" named both **Hide** and **Destroy**. Resolved: see **Lifecycle verbs**.
  The public `Agentic.close` keeps its name for API compatibility but performs a
  **Hide**, as does the `q` keymap. Two user-facing docs shipped disagreeing about
  which one `q` did — hence the pinned verbs.
- "Replace" was used for tabpage eviction and for ending one conversation in
  favor of another. Resolved: **Evict** only hides; **Replace** commits a ready
  target and applies its requested source lifecycle. Restore retains the source
  unless the user selects destruction.
- "Agent" was used to mean **Provider** subprocess, **AgentInstance** singleton
  factory/cache, **ACPClient**, and the LLM behind the provider. Resolved:
  **Provider** for the subprocess, **AgentInstance** for the singleton
  factory/cache, and **ACPClient** for the cached client; the LLM is not a
  domain concept here.
- "Tool call" was used to mean both the protocol event and its rendered block.
  Resolved: **Tool Call** for the event, **Tool Call Block** for the rendering.
- "Diff" was used to mean both the in-chat diff and the file-buffer preview.
  Resolved: **ToolCallDiff** (in-chat) vs **DiffPreview** (in-file).
- "Tracker" appears in `MessageWriter` code (`tracker.diff`,
  `tracker.permission`). Local-variable name, not a domain concept. Do not
  introduce it in docs.
- "Focus" was used to mean Neovim window focus and **PermissionManager** focus
  (which **Tool Call Block** has buttons active and digit keymaps bound).
  Resolved: bare "focus" = Neovim's window focus; "permission focus" or "focused
  block" for the **PermissionManager** notion.
- "status row", "status footer" refer to the same line: the last row of a **Tool
  Call Block**, outside the fold range. Canonical: **status row**. ("row N" was
  used pre-refactor and overlapped with the permission rows now rendered between
  `bottom_pad` and the status row; avoid the term.)
- "Functional test" vs "integration test" — `tests/AGENTS.md` once split these
  into separate categories with overlapping definitions. The split was not
  load-bearing. Resolved: treat as one category. Use either folder
  (`tests/functional/`, `tests/integration/`) when a test spans more than one
  module or needs real Neovim state across them; no formal distinction.
